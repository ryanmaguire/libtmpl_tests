 *      More accurate complex multiplication for embedded processors.         *
 *      Claude-Pierre Jeannerod, Christophe Monat, Laurent Thevenoux          *
 *      12th IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Embedded Systems      *
 *      (SIES 2017), Jun 2017, Toulouse, France.                              *
 *  They provide two complex numbers z = a + ib and w = c + id such that the  *
 *  naive product (ac - bd) + i (ad + bc) has horrible component-wise         *
 *  relative error. They are:                                                 *
 *                                                                            *
 *      z = (1 + 2^-51) + i (1 + 3 * 2^-52)                                   *
 *      w = (1 - 2^-53) + i (1 - 3 * 2^-53)                                   *
 *                                                                            *
 *  The naive product produces zero for the imaginary part, but it should be  *
 *  7 * 2^-110 ~= 1.72 x 10^-31, meaning the relative error for the imaginary *
 *  part is 1. The real part is ~2, meaning the relative error for the whole  *
 *  complex number using either the L1 or L2 norm is ~1.11 x 10^-16, which is *
 *  indeed less than double precision epsilon.                                *
 *                                                                            *
 *  At the time of this writing, libtmpl, like many other libraries and       *
 *  programs, uses the naive product. The algorithm in the paper above to     *
 *  remediate this issue uses the FMA instruction, which libtmpl does not     *
 *  currently implement. This would also slow the computation down            *
 *  considerable for architectures that do not have FMA. There is no current  *
 *  plan to implement the corrected algorithm in libtmpl. Because of this,    *
 *  this test is no run by the "runtest.sh" scripts since the extension is    *
 *  .c.norun, instead of .c.                                                  */
